##Description
a site for an animal shelter which allows adoption of cats and dogs. These are the only two animals allowed in the shelter. The adoption process works strictly on a first-in, first-out basis. People can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but they may only adopt the animals that have been in the shelter the longest.

##Technologies Used
The site uses a queue data structure to hold an array of objects that inlcudes the pets information. For the front-end of this project, we used React, Redux, Redux-Thunk. The back-end of the project has been created using Express and Node. Netlify and Heroku have been used for deployment.
